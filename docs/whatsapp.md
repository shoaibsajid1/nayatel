## Port 25

```
Nayatel has blocked SMTP port 25 to prevent our IP addresses and AS number from being blacklisted globally. You are requested to use secure ports 587 or 465 for SMTP connectivity.

You can refer to the following URL for guidance on how to change ports on different platforms: https://bit.ly/3KVmvSu 

We would highly appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this regard.
```
## Port 25 Allowed

```
Port 25 has been allowed for the mentioned mailing server for two weeks. In the meanwhile, please have secure ports configured in your workstation(s) and, if required, persuade your email hosting provider to shift to secure SMTP ports for seamless delivery of your emails. Till then, in case, any spam is generated from your IP address, all of the SMTP ports i.e., 25, 587 and 465 will be blocked against your connection. Furthermore, if your IP address is listed in any RBL then you will have to proceed for IP address de-listing at your end and also share precautionary measures taken to prevent spam generation. Once the precautionary measures are reviewed at our end (and are acceptable), only then the secured SMTP ports will be allowed again.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
