Following are some important points for future in order to have a clear understanding for this specific service:

 

There will be no pro rata charges against any package of NWall (Monthly/Annual).
Home Customers will only avail Annual package from now onwards and activity will be scheduled separately for NWall monthly home customers to shift these on Annual plan depending upon their expiry of licenses.
Kindly ensure that packages should be assigned to customers on the basis of their nature e-g cooperate plan are for revenue generating organizations, NPO plans are for non-profitable organizations, PSO plans are for public sector organizations & Home plan is just for Home Customers (not for cooperate customers with Home Internet Plans).
 There will be 10% discount on total charges if customer wants to convert his/her Monthly Plan into Annual Plan. Annual Plans prices are already 10% discounted.
